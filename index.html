								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/portrait_pink.png" alt="Portrait of Gavin Philips" /></span>
								<p>As a child, I found that the best people around were often those with disabilities. I spent most of my recesses 
									with my friends in the special ed classroom, and countless hours playing video games with Ty (who constantly 
									beat me with his one good hand). When I went off to college to become an engineer, they were always on my mind.</p>
								<p>During my undergrad and master's programs at the University of Wyoming, I modified power wheelchairs to be controlled by eye movements
									and obstacle-avoiding sensors. Afterwards, I spent a few years working at an assistive technology clinic, where I
									learned about people with disabilities and the tools they use from a team of incredible physical/occupational
									therapists and speech pathologists. We configured complex power wheelchairs, speech-generating devices,
									environmental control systems, computer access methods, and custom video game controllers for clients with a vast
									range of abilities.</p>
								<p>Eventually, I decided that I could help more people, and those with more severe disabilities, through brain-computer
									interfaces (BCIs). So I joined the University of Florida Computational NeuroEngineering Lab, and obtained a Ph.D. in
									electrical and computer engineering. My work there in robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation introduced me to
									the obstacles that impede progress in EEG-based BCIs, so I moved on to tackle those issues with magnetic fields
									and nanoparticles as a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>
								<p>Moving forward, my ultimate goal is to enable people with severe disabilities to fully engage in their lives. To this
									end, I have three objectives:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Advance the state of the art in assistive technology</li>
									<li>Produce and disseminate devices that can <em>immediately</em> improve the lives of people with disabilities</li>
									<li>Engender in generations of students a deep understanding of, and desire to serve, people with disabilities</li>
								</ol>

								<p>It is fairly common for a person with severe disabilities to interact with his or her environment by using a 
									single switch, selected from a <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches">wide variety</a> of available "ability switches." Wheelchairs, computers, 
									speech generating devices, environmental control units, and more can be controlled with a single switch. 
									This also extends to the world of video games, and <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/">OneSwitch</a> provides a superb overview of single switch 
									gaming.</p>
						
								<p>Often, one switch games must be designed from scratch, to accommodate the reduced number of inputs. 
									Independent game development for the PC is common, but is much more rare in the world of consoles 
									(i.e., XBox, Playstation, etc.). Fortunately, many of the available guitar or band mimicking games 
									include a "beginner mode," which requires the user only to activate the "strum bar" of the controller. 
									This means that these games are perfectly suited to one switch play. All that's left is to connect the 
									ubiquitous 3.5mm mono jack to a guitar controller.</p>
						
								<p>Barrie of OneSwitch has already hacked a Rock Band <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/4/DIY/rockband-guitar.htm">guitar</a> 
									and <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/4/DIY/rockband-drums.htm">drums</a> for this purpose.  However, <a href="http://www.playntrade.com/">Play-N-Trade</a> 
									donated a Guitar Hero World Tour set to ATP for AbleGames, which required a slightly different process of switch 
									adaptation.</p>
						
								<p>I switch adapted the "strum bar" for one switch play, which was extremely successful at AbleGames 2009 and 2010. 
									Later, I switch adapted each of the colored "fret" buttons, in hopes that a team of 4-6 people with 
									disabilities could play the game as a team, with each controlling a single switch.</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="/images/battery_inter.jpg" alt="Commercially available battery interrupters" /></span>
						
								<p>A battery interrupter is a tool that adds a switch jack to (aka "switch adapts") an electrical device.</p>
								<p>This is usually done for the purpose of allowing a person with disabilities to use that device, by using an "ability switch," which can be anything from a 
									plastic button to a muscle twitch sensor.  These switches are almost always wired to a 3.5mm (1/8") mono plug, and can be connected to anything with a 
									matching jack.  They are used with power wheelchairs, computers, speech devices, toys, remote controls, and so on.</p>
								<p>A battery interrupter allows us to add a switch jack to a device that:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Is powered by AA, AAA, C, or D batteries.</li>
									<li>Simply turns on or off with a single switch (like the infamous cymbal-crashing monkey).</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A battery interrupter is simply a 3.5mm jack, with each of the two wires connected to small metal plates, which are separated by an insulator (like tape or 
									thick paper).  These plates are placed between the batteries of a device, effectively redirecting the electrical circuit through the 3.5mm jack, so that 
									it can be opened and closed with a switch.</p>
								<p>Enabling Devices sells battery interrupters <a href="https://enablingdevices.com/catalog/useful-devices/battery_interrupters/battery-interrupters">here</a> 
									(and the manual is <a href="/docs/Battery_interrupter_manual.pdf">here</a>). You can also make your own battery 
									interrupters by soldering a pair of wires (or a speaker wire) to a 3.5mm jack and to two small metal plates separated by double-sided tape or some other 
									thin insulator.  However, if you are not comfortable soldering, this guide will teach you how to make a battery interrupter with only a few dollars worth 
									of parts (or the scraps left from making a <a href="#cdswitch">CD Switch</a>).</p>
								<p><strong>I have posted an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/No-Solder-Battery-Interrupter/">Instructable</a>, so that anyone can easily make their own 
									no-solder battery interrupters.</strong> I suggest making one of these along with a <a href="#cdswitch">CD Switch</a>, 
									as they work well together, and the battery interrupter can be made of the scraps left from building the switch.</p>
								<p>A <a href="/docs/battery_interrupter_instructable.pdf">PDF version</a> of the Instructable is also available.</p>
								<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> I used two of these to build the <a href="#combatchair">Nerf Combat Wheelchair</a>.</p>

								<p>In the realm of assistive technology, a switch (aka "ability switch") can be anything from a plastic button to a muscle twitch sensor. A 
									<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches">wide variety of switches</a> are available, and can be selected to fit the 
									needs of each user. These switches are almost always wired to a 3.5mm (1/8") mono plug, and can be connected to anything with a matching jack. They are used 
									with power wheelchairs, computers, speech devices, toys, remote controls, and so on.</p>
								<p>The problem is that switches are expensive.  A basic Jellybean Switch or Buddy Button costs around $50-60 (USD), for just a plastic button.  While these are worth 
									their weight in gold, the price is still a bit steep, especially in the low-budget/non-profit world of assistive technology.</p>
								<p>Sometimes, it's handy to make your own.</p>
								<p>Fortunately, a switch is a very simple thing.  It's just a circuit closing, just two wires touching.  We will use less than $10 (USD) worth of parts to let a person 
									press a surface (in this case a CD), and touch two wires together.  R. J. Cooper also sells 
									<a href="https://store.rjcooper.com/products/switch-kits-cd?variant=48031358863">CD Switch Kits</a> for about $10 (USD) each, in packs of five or ten.</p>
								<p>Save the left over scraps from this project, as you can use them to build a <a href="#batteryint">No-Solder Battery Interrupter</a>, which you can use to let this 
									switch control toys and other devices.</p>
								<p><strong>I have posted an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/CD-Switch/">Instructable</a>, so that anyone can easily make their own CD Switches.</strong> I suggest making one 
									of these along with a <a href="#batteryint">Solderless Battery Interrupter</a>, 
									as they work well together, and the battery interrupter can be made of the scraps left from building the switch.</p>

								<p><strong>A quick note first:</strong> AbleGames is not associated with <a href="http://www.ablegamers.org/">The AbleGamers Foundation</a>.</p>
								<p>AbleGames (later SwitchItUp) was a program of <a href="http://www.assistivetechnologypartners.org/">Assistive Technology Partners</a> that ran for three years. 
									Many people were involved. I just coordinated and prepared the games and technology, and tried to keep them working during the event.

								<h2 class="major" style="width:100%">Nerf combat wheelchair</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/combat_wheelchair.png" alt="Wheelchair with Nerf machineguns mounted" /></span>
						
								<p>You might ask yourself, "Why would anyone mount dual Nerf machine guns on a wheelchair, and hack it to fire them from the drive controls?"</p>
								<p>I might ask you why you hate fun.</p>
								<p>The guns can be fired by any drive control connected to the chair.  Joystick, head array, chin/mouth stick, sip and puff, single switch, etc.  Pick your poison.</p>
								<p>I used an Invacare wheelchair with Mark VI electronics, but this can be done with any power wheelchair that can use an "ECU 1/2" or "ECU 3/4" box.  (These connect to the chair's 
									electronics and have two 9-pin D-sub ports for output.  They are commonly used for controlling speech generating devices or computers.)</p>
								<p>Some of the parts may be quite expensive, but it's possible to find cheaper alternatives if you get creative.</p>
								<p>The recipe:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Switch adapt two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Vulcan-EBF-25-Blaster/dp/B0013U95U2/">Nerf Vulcan machine guns</a> using <a href="#batteryint">battery interrupters</a> and two zip ties. 
										(<strong>Edit:</strong> It seems the Nerf Vulcan has become quite rare/expensive, so see the bottom of the page for alternatives.)</li>
									<li>Acquire two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-143N-Magic-Arm-without/dp/B000HI8L38/">Manfrotto Magic Arms</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-Magic-Backlite-Stand-Super/dp/B000J4GQVE/">kits</a> 
										(which are the same thing as "<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/mounting-cases">Universal Mounts</a>," 
										but cheaper because they aren't marketed as assistive technology...), and two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-035RL-Super-Clamp-Standard/dp/B0018LQVIA/">extra clamps</a> (four clamps total).</li>
									<li>Attach a clamp to each end of each Magic Arm.</li>
									<li>For each gun, clamp one end of the arm onto the tripod's mount, and the other onto the frame of the wheelchair.  Adjust to position and aim however you like.</li>
									<li>Mount an "ECU 1/2" or "ECU 3/4" box on the wheelchair and connect it to the chair's electronics. 
										(This is the sort of thing that a supplier or clinic would do for you, as it requires a brand-specific wheelchair programming device.)</li>
									<li>Plug a 9-pin D-sub to 3.5mm splitter cable (like one of the "802-" cables show <a href="http://www.asl-inc.com/products/catalogs/Catalog-Series800.pdf">here</a> or a home-made version) into one of the ports of the ECU box.</li>
									<li>Choose two of the 3.5mm plugs (left and right, or whichever directions work best for the user while driving the chair), 
										and plug them into the battery interrupters of the Nerf guns.  (Alternatively, use a Y-adapter and connect one plug to both guns.)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>That's it!  Now, tap your mode switch (or whatever you have to do with your brand of wheelchair) to switch into ECU mode, and move your joystick (or whatever drive control you use).  You are now driving an AH-64 Apache attack wheelchair. 
									Paint some shark teeth on that beast and show 'em who's boss!</p>
								<p><strong>A note on Nerf guns:</strong> Apparently, the Nerf Vulcan has become quite rare and/or expensive these days, but there are other guns that will do the job. 
									As you can see in <a href="http://switchgaming.blogspot.com/2014/04/wadsa-accessible-sports.html">this fantastic video</a>, others have set up similar rigs with the 
									<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-94665-N-Strike-Stampede-ECS/dp/B003774W6Q/">N-Strike Stampede ECS</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-32218-Vortex-Nitron/dp/B004SKX8M0/">Vortex Nitron</a>. 
									While I have not experimented with either of these myself, I expect that the Stampede can be adapted very similarly to the Vulcan. 
									The Vortex Nitron might (or might not) be slightly more complicated to adapt, as it looks like it may have a secondary switch to turn on the motor, 
									but you may be able to just turn it on and leave it.  After a quick test, the 
									<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Rapidstrike-Blaster/dp/B00BG8F0H8/">Rapidstrike CS-18</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Rayven-Blaster/dp/B009T45XVE/">Rayven CS-18</a> don't seem to be viable options, 
									as they have a secondary trigger that must be held to power the motor, which complicates things. 
									It seems that new models continue to be released, while old models skyrocket in price, so it may take some research to find the right gun. If the price is more than $100 (USD), it's probably an overpriced old model.</p>
								<p>As of October 2017, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXT52FY/">N-Strike Elite Rhino-Fire Blaster</a> looks like the most likely candidate at ~$70 (USD), but I haven't tested it myself.</p>
								<p>If you want to try this out, I will gladly provide more details.</p>
