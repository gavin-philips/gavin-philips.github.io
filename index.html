								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/portrait_pink.png" alt="Portrait of Gavin Philips" /></span>
								<p>As a child, I found that the best people around were often those with disabilities. I spent most of my recesses 
									with my friends in the special ed classroom, and countless hours playing video games with Ty (who constantly 
									beat me with his one good hand). When I went off to college to become an engineer, they were always on my mind.</p>
								<p>During my undergrad and master's programs at the University of Wyoming, I modified power wheelchairs to be controlled by eye movements
									and obstacle-avoiding sensors. Afterwards, I spent a few years at an assistive technology clinic, where I
									worked closely with people who have disabilities, along with a team of incredible physical/occupational
									therapists and speech pathologists. We configured complex power wheelchairs, speech-generating devices,
									environmental control systems, computer access methods, and custom video game controllers for clients with a vast
									range of abilities.</p>
								<p>Eventually, I decided that I could help more people, and those with more severe disabilities, through brain-computer
									interfaces (BCIs). So I joined the University of Florida Computational NeuroEngineering Lab, and obtained a Ph.D. in
									electrical and computer engineering. My work there in robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation introduced me to
									the obstacles that impede progress in EEG-based BCIs, so I moved on to tackle those issues with magnetic fields
									and nanoparticles as a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>
								<p>Moving forward, my ultimate goal is to enable people with severe disabilities to fully engage in their lives. To this
									end, I have three objectives:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Advance the state of the art in assistive technology</li>
									<li>Produce and disseminate devices that can <em>immediately</em> improve the lives of people with disabilities</li>
									<li>Engender in generations of students a deep understanding of, and desire to serve, people with disabilities</li>
								</ol>

								<p>I performed my Ph.D. research in the Computational NeuroEngineering Lab at the University of Florida and the Brain Rehabilitation Research Center at the Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center. 
									There I focused on developing biomarkers that could be used to guide and evaluate motor rehabilitation after stroke. I applied nonparametric measures of association and graph theory to elicit and quantify 
									functional connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG). Several graph metrics were found to correlate with functional improvement, indicating their potential utility in prognosis and evaluation of therapeutic outcomes, 
									as well as BCI-enabled biofeedback.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="width:100%">Eye controlled wheelchair</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="/images/EOG_chair.JPG" alt="Wheelchair with electronics for eye control" /></span>
						
								<p>This adventure began as my senior design project, for which Andrew Catellier and I received the Best Team Project award. 
									After graduation, I continued the project, and it became the focus of my master's thesis. Due to complications in the filtering and analysis of EOG (electrooculogram) signals, 
									the wheelchair served only as a proof of concept, and could not be tested by a subject with disabilities. I have decided to take a new approach, 
									which begins with designing a <a href="#chairinterface">universal Computer-Wheelchair Interface</a>.</p>
								<p>The prompt was to design a way for a person who could not use his/her hands to control a wheelchair. This is currently accomplished through a variety of methods, 
									including arrays of proximity sensors placed in a headrest, chin/mouth joysticks, "sip and puff" units that sense the pressure of a user's breath in a tube, 
									single switch scanning methods that can utilize a variety of "ability switches," and many more. Unfortunately, the needs and abilities of each user vary greatly, 
									as does the effectiveness of each control method. We decided to add another option to the collective toolbox: eye movement.</p>
								<p>Eye tracking is already used by people with disabilities for communication. A person who cannot speak may use an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device, 
									the most complicated of which are rugged tablet PCs with specialized software installed. Several such devices are now available with infrared VOG (videooculogram) 
									based eye tracking, including offerings from <a href="https://www.tobiidynavox.com/products/devices/">Tobii Dynavox</a>, 
									<a href="https://www.eyetechds.com/tm5-mini-assistive-tech.html">EyeTech</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.cogain.org/index.php/Eye_Trackers">many more</a>. 
									Our approach instead utilizes EOG (electrooculogram), which does not require any hardware to placed in the user's field of view.</p>
								<p>While EOG can sense both vertical and horizontal movement of the eyes, we opted to use only horizontal movement for steering, as it seemed impractical for a user to 
									look up and down in order to move forward and backward. Instead, the chair cycles through modes, including "conversation," "pivot," "forward," and "backward." 
									These modes are controlled by a pair of 3.5 mm (1/8") mono jacks, which are compatible with most "<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches">ability switches</a>." 
									For testing, a "sip and puff" unit was used.</p>
								<p>The system is controlled by a Motorola HCS12 "Minidragon" microcontroller, and powered by four 7.2 volt battery packs (in order isolate the user from the wheelchair's power system).</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the DC drift inherent in EOG signals makes them very difficult to use for control of such a system. 
									<a href="https://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/eagleeyes/">The EagleEyes system</a> utilizes a DC blocking filter to circumvent this problem, but while continually drifting toward 
									center is acceptable for a mouse cursor, it is impractical for wheelchair control. In addition, the process of reverse engineering and hacking the electronics of the existing 
									wheelchair is time consuming and introduces liability issues.</p>
								<p>I plan to address these problems and take advantage of existing eye tracking technology through a new approach, described in my <a href="#chairinterface">Computer-Wheelchair Interface project</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="width:100%">Wireless computer-wheelchair interface</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="/images/wheelchair_interface.jpg" alt="Electronics for wireless computer-wheelchair interface" /></span>
						
								<p>In designing the <a href="#eyechair">eye-controlled wheelchair</a>, it was necessary to reverse engineer the available power wheelchair and hack into its proprietary circuitry. 
									This process took quite a while, and has been repeated by many other researchers around the world. This seems like a waste of time that could be 
									better spent developing improved input methods, control algorithms, environmental sensors, and so on. No one likes reinventing the wheel.</p>
								<p>In order to alleviate this issue, I have done some work to develop a universal computer-wheelchair interface, which would handle that part of the 
									puzzle and allow researchers to focus their time on more important endeavors.  In addition, this will allow users to take advantage of currently 
									existing computer access methods, such as head trackers, specialized mice, keyboards, joysticks, touch screens, single or double switch scanning, etc. 
									Combining such a tool with preexisting eye trackers (like those from Tobii and Dynavox) would result in an improved alternative to my previous 
									<a href="#eyechair">eye-controlled wheelchair</a>. Finally, the use of a common PC as a controller (as opposed to one or more microcontrollers) would make software 
									development more accessible, opening doors for work in self-localization, mapping, obstacle avoidance, semi-autonomous navigation, docking, 
									input smoothing/correction, and other avenues of smart wheelchair research.</p>
								<p>The current version of my interface uses an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> microcontroller and Bluetooth to allow a computer, tablet, or smart phone to wirelessly control 
									most of the power wheelchairs that accept "alternative drive controls." The four major power wheelchair brands in the U.S. 
									(Invacare, Pride/Quantum, Quickie, and Permobil) use different, proprietary connections to interface with specialized drive controls. 
									Some developers (like <a href="http://www.asl-inc.com/">Adaptive Switch Labs</a>) produce products that interface with these connections, but these are generally brand-specific. 
									I have, however, discovered that nearly any such power wheelchair accepts a 9-pin D-sub connection, though occasionally an additional adapter is required. 
									(Invacare Mark 6i electronics, for example, may require the ASL 151MK6i shown <a href="/docs/ASL_interface_components.pdf">here</a>.) This connection is utilized by a variety of 
									<a href="https://mobilitybasics.ca/wheelchairs/drivecontrols">drive controls</a>, 
									such as wafer boards and external switch scanning systems. This plug is actually the same connection as an old 
									<a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/4/DIY/retro-pinouts.htm">Atari joystick</a>, which just expects a 
									circuit connection between a particular pin and the ground pin to move in a particular direction. If you connect a wire between the "forward" pin and 
									the ground pin, the chair will move forward.</p>
								<p>The pins (at least for non-proportional control) for all four major U.S. power wheelchair brands are:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Forward</li>
									<li>Reverse</li>
									<li>Left</li>
									<li>Right</li>
									<li>(no connection)</li>
									<li>"Fire" (a.k.a. reset, emergency stop. I haven't experimented with this much yet.)</li>
									<li>Power (+5v on the chairs that I have tested. You can draw from most chairs to power an Arduino or other microcontroller, but probably not with an Invacare chair.)</li>
									<li>Ground (a.k.a. common)</li>
									<li>(no connection)</li>
								</ol>
								<p>You can easily figure out the power and control voltages (3, 5, or 12 volts) of your particular chair by connecting a multimeter between the ground and each of the other pins. 
									However, the control voltage shouldn't matter, because you're just connecting one pin to the other. I used the exact same device with all four wheelchair brands, without 
									modification, and it worked fine.</p>
								<p>In order to mimic a "switch closure" and connect two pins of the interface with a microcontroller, you can use a simple transistor (I used the 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N3904">2N3904 BJT</a>). 
									Connect the collector pin of the transistor to the desired control (forward, reverse, left, or right) pin of the 9-pin D-sub connector, and the emitter pin to the ground (pin 8). 
									Then connect the base pin of the transistor to a digital output pin of the microcontroller, through a 4.7 kiloohm resistor (as shown 
									<a href="/docs/wheelchair_interface_schematic.png">here</a>). When that particular digital 
									output pin of the microcontroller turns on, current will flow from the control pin to the ground pin, through the transistor. Repeat this circuit for each of the four directions, 
									and once for the "fire"/mode pin if desired.</p>
								<p>It is important to note that my current design only gives non-proportional control thus far, as it just mimics switch closures between different pins of that 9-pin plug. 
									(Proportional control allows the user to vary the speed of movement/turning, as with a standard joystick. Non-proportional control is simply on/off in each direction, 
									like four buttons.) I have been told that some systems (like the newer Quantum enhanced displays) can also take proportional control through that same plug, and I have an idea 
									of how that might work, but I haven't tested it. I would guess that, in place of the transistor that "mimics a switch," you could use a digital potentiometer to vary the 
									resistance between two particular pins. Then the pin for a particular direction would receive a lower voltage than the full "switch closure" (which is 3, 5, or 12 volts, 
									depending on the brand of chair), and hopefully drive proportionally. This is just my guess, though. If you know more on this topic, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
								
								<br>
								<p><strong>Update:</strong> A very helpful occupational therapist from France (Julien OUDIN) pointed out to me that the 
									<a href="http://sunrise.pgdrivestechnology.com/manuals/pgdt_omni_manual_sk78813-03.pdf">R-Net Omni technical manual</a> is publicly available, and includes 
									specifications for both digital and analog/proportional interfaces (starting on page 129). Last I checked, both Quickie and Permobil chairs used R-Net electronics, and I 
									suspect the other brands have very similar specifications. I haven't built an analog/proportional interface myself yet, but it shouldn't be too difficult with this information. 
									I have also hosted the manual <a href="/docs/pgdt_omni_manual.pdf">here</a>, in case the previous link changes at some point.</p>
								<p>Regardless of how you end up physically connecting a microcontroller (like an Arduino) to the chair, sending signals to that microcontroller from a computer or smart phone via 
									Bluetooth is pretty cheap and easy (especially if you use an Arduino). I used a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12577">BlueSMiRF Silver</a> connected directly to 
									the serial pins of an <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11224">Arduino Uno</a>. 
									The code running on the microcontroller just reads serial data; I never even had to think about how Bluetooth actually works. The code itself is fairly simple, as it just 
									reads from a serial port and turns on/off a few pins (which control the "switch mimicking" transistors). I used <a href="/docs/Bluetooth_Wheelchair_Control.pde">this code</a>, 
									with the free "<a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>" environment, but I would 
									assume that you could do the same or something similar with any such tool.</p>
								<p><strong>The layout and code are available in one package in 
									<a href="/docs/wheelchair_Interface_fritzing.fzz">this Fritzing file</a>.</strong> (Learn more about <a href="http://fritzing.org">Fritzing</a> here.)</p>
								<p>In order to power the microcontroller, you can usually draw power (5 volts) directly from the chair on pin 7. If it is an Invacare chair, or some other brand that doesn't provide power on pin 7, you can simply connect a small battery 
									(a 9 volt would be perfect). If, for example, you pack an Arduino, BlueSMiRF, and a small circuit board with the transistors into a box with a 9-pin plug, you should be able 
									to mount it on the chair somewhere out of the way.</p>
								<p>Any computer, tablet, or smart phone with Bluetooth should be able to pair with the BlueSMiRF through the standard Bluetooth pairing process. 
									Then you simply send commands to the port that is associated with that Bluetooth connection. In my code, the commands are simply the letters a, b, c, d, and e. 
									You can change these to anything you like. My code also functions in "latched mode," meaning that a "forward" command will make the chair move forward until it receives a stop command. 
									Any letter other than a, b, c, d, or e will stop all movement immediately. You could easily change this behavior by adding a delay after each digitalwrite() command, and then setting 
									the same pin back to LOW. I used <a href="http://www.putty.org/">Putty</a> to send Bluetooth serial commands from a laptop computer, but there are many ways to send Bluetooth commands. I'm sure you could do something 
									far more creative and useful, like building a graphical user interface, or passing user inputs (mouse, keyboard, eye tracker, etc.) through a tool like <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> 
									or <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/">EventGhost</a>.</p>
								<p>With this setup, I can sit across the room and drive a wheelchair wirelessly with my laptop/tablet.</p>
								
								<br>
								<p>In order to implement a new eye-controlled wheelchair from this point, the following would be necessary:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Tablet or laptop PC with commercially available eye tracker mounted in front of the user</li>
									<li>Webcam aiming forward, at what would be the user's view from the wheelchair</li>
									<li>Real-time stream from webcam displayed on the PC's screen, possibly with a HUD/overlay for control of forward/back, speed, and mode</li>
									<li>The aforementioned computer-wheelchair interface to pass cursor movements (as controlled by the eye tracker) to the wheelchair</li>
								</ul>
								<p>One major drawback to this method thus far has been the fact that a tablet PC or AAC device with an eye tracker generally cost $8,000-15,000 (USD). Fortunately, inexpensive eye trackers 
									have appeared, like those marketed for gaming by <a href="https://tobiigaming.com/products/">Tobii</a>. (Unfortunately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-eye-tribe/">The Eye Tribe</a> was sold to Facebook for Oculus integration.)
									This could also be circumvented by using a home-built or open source eye tracker (like one of <a href="http://www.jasonbabcock.com/eyetracking_hardware.html">Jason Babcock's designs</a>).
									Many other options are <a href="http://wiki.cogain.org/index.php/Eye_Trackers">listed by COGAIN</a></p>
								<p>I plan to continue working on this project, but I would be very happy to see how others tackle this problem, especially as this may be the perfect scope for an engineering senior design project.</p>

								<h2 class="major" style="width:100%">Custom Xbox 360 controller for user with muscular dystrophy</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/xbox_use.png" alt="The user with his Xbox 360 controller and various switches" /></span>
						
								<p>A young man who loves playing XBox 360 games online with his friends has muscular dystrophy.  Initially, the standard XBox 360 controller 
									has been an incredible tool for him, as it fits his hands, allows him to actuate the controls with minimal strength and range of motion, 
									and can also be used to control a personal computer.  Unfortunately, as MD is a progressive condition, the controller became 
									increasingly difficult for him to use.</p>
								<p>In order to address this problem, I worked with a fantastic occupational therapist (<a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Engineering/research/AssistiveTechnologyPartners/about-us/faculty/Pages/Breaux,%20Becky.aspx">Beacky Breaux</a>)
									to determine whether a controller could be modified to fit his abilities.</p>
								<p>I used an electric kitchen knife to carve a block of wheelchair seating foam into a replica of a controller, complete with mock thumb sticks. 
									When positioned in his hands, this allowed us to evaluate his range of motion and determine the ideal placement of the thumb sticks and 
									buttons. This template was then used to create the design for a new, accessible controller. In conjunction with this first design, 
									it was necessary to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Soften the pull of both triggers</li>
									<li>Move the right thumb stick up and to the right, symmetrical to the left thumb stick</li>
									<li>Rearrange the X, Y, A, and B buttons (as shown in the first mock-up image)</li>
									<li>Replace the D-Pad with an analog thumb stick</li>
									<li>Connect four 3.5mm mono jacks to actuate the "click" of the left and right thumb sticks, and the "down" and "right" functions of the D-Pad</li>
								</ul>
								<p>(3.5mm mono jacks are very common in the assistive technology field, and are compatible with most "ability switches."  This person uses several 
									"<a href="http://enablingdevices.com/catalog/capability_switches/wheelchair-bedside-switches/ultimate-switch-accessories">Ultimate Switches</a>" 
									placed around his head, and two <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/string-switch">string switches</a> attached to his toes to actuate the functions associated with these 3.5mm jacks.)</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/xbox_draw1.png" alt="A modified Xbox 360 controller, version 1" /></span>
								<p>This plan was sent to <a href="http://www.benheck.com/">Ben Heckendorn</a> (a.k.a. Ben Heck), who hacked a standard XBox 360 controller into shape, making the requested modifications.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the modified controller wasn't a perfect fit. The user could not reach the X or A buttons consistently, 
									and the replacement of the D-Pad with a thumb stick didn't improve function as expected. However, the other modifications worked beautifully. 
									This is a complex problem, and some trial and error is expected, but it's still frustrating when things don't work out as you hope.</p>
								<p>So plans were drawn up for version 2. The following changes to the previously modified controller were required:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Replace the new thumb stick with the original D-Pad</li>
									<li>Move the X button back to the right side of the controller, and move the A button to the right side of the B button (as shown in the second image)</li>
									<li>Connect four more 3.5mm jacks to actuate the X and Y buttons, and the D-Pad "up" and "left" (in case he cannot use them, or he loses the ability as his condition progresses)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Because the D-Pad contacts of the controller were destroyed during the addition of the thumb stick, it was necessary to start over with a fresh controller, 
									rather than continuing to modify the same one. Ben Heckendorn continued the work, and sent along version 2 for testing.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/xbox_draw2.png" alt="A modified Xbox 360 controller, version 2" /></span>
								<p>In summary, the modifications to the fresh XBox 360 controller were:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Soften the pull of both triggers</li>
									<li>Move the right thumb stick up and to the right, symmetrical to the left thumb stick</li>
									<li>Rearrange the X, Y, A, and B buttons (as shown in the second mock-up image)</li>
									<li>Connect eight 3.5mm jacks to actuate the X and Y buttons, both thumb stick "clicks," and all four directions of the D-Pad</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With these modifications, version 2 was a success! Though the addition of switch jacks rendered the D-Pad nonfunctional, 
									he can use separate switches for all four directions when necessary. As shown above, he currently uses:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The modified controller, carefully positioned on the bed, between his legs</li>
									<li>One button-type switch (Jelly Bean, Buddy Button, etc.) attached to the pillow behind his head with Velcro</li>
									<li>Two "<a href="http://enablingdevices.com/catalog/capability_switches/wheelchair-bedside-switches/ultimate-switch-accessories">Ultimate Switches</a>," one to the left of his head, and one below his chin</li>
									<li>Two <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/string-switch">String Switches</a>, which he pulls with his toes (mounted on boxes that I built from tri-wall cardboard, wrapped in wheelchair seating foam)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Each switch can be plugged into any jack, and used for any of the available functions, so they can be tailored to fit each game. 
									If he later discovers that he needs more switches, they can easily be added. A "sip and puff" switch is a likely option.</p>

								<p>It is fairly common for a person with severe disabilities to interact with his or her environment by using a 
									single switch, selected from a <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches">wide variety</a> of available "ability switches." Wheelchairs, computers, 
									speech generating devices, environmental control units, and more can be controlled with a single switch. 
									This also extends to the world of video games, and <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/">OneSwitch</a> provides a superb overview of single switch 
									gaming.</p>
						
								<p>Often, one switch games must be designed from scratch, to accommodate the reduced number of inputs. 
									Independent game development for the PC is common, but is much more rare in the world of consoles 
									(i.e., XBox, Playstation, etc.). Fortunately, many of the available guitar or band mimicking games 
									include a "beginner mode," which requires the user only to activate the "strum bar" of the controller. 
									This means that these games are perfectly suited to one switch play. All that's left is to connect the 
									ubiquitous 3.5mm mono jack to a guitar controller.</p>
						
								<p>Barrie of OneSwitch has already hacked a Rock Band <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/4/DIY/rockband-guitar.htm">guitar</a> 
									and <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/4/DIY/rockband-drums.htm">drums</a> for this purpose.  However, <a href="http://www.playntrade.com/">Play-N-Trade</a> 
									donated a Guitar Hero World Tour set to ATP for AbleGames, which required a slightly different process of switch 
									adaptation.</p>
						
								<p>I switch adapted the "strum bar" for one switch play, which was extremely successful at AbleGames 2009 and 2010. 
									Later, I switch adapted each of the colored "fret" buttons, in hopes that a team of 4-6 people with 
									disabilities could play the game as a team, with each controlling a single switch.</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="/images/battery_inter.jpg" alt="Commercially available battery interrupters" /></span>
						
								<p>A battery interrupter is a tool that adds a switch jack to (aka "switch adapts") an electrical device.</p>
								<p>This is usually done for the purpose of allowing a person with disabilities to use that device, by using an "ability switch," which can be anything from a 
									plastic button to a muscle twitch sensor.  These switches are almost always wired to a 3.5mm (1/8") mono plug, and can be connected to anything with a 
									matching jack.  They are used with power wheelchairs, computers, speech devices, toys, remote controls, and so on.</p>
								<p>A battery interrupter allows us to add a switch jack to a device that:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Is powered by AA, AAA, C, or D batteries.</li>
									<li>Simply turns on or off with a single switch (like the infamous cymbal-crashing monkey).</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A battery interrupter is simply a 3.5mm jack, with each of the two wires connected to small metal plates, which are separated by an insulator (like tape or 
									thick paper).  These plates are placed between the batteries of a device, effectively redirecting the electrical circuit through the 3.5mm jack, so that 
									it can be opened and closed with a switch.</p>
								<p>Enabling Devices sells battery interrupters <a href="https://enablingdevices.com/catalog/useful-devices/battery_interrupters/battery-interrupters">here</a> 
									(and the manual is <a href="/docs/Battery_interrupter_manual.pdf">here</a>). Ablenet has them for $15 (USD) 
									<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/product-accessories/battery-device-adapter-aa-aaa-size">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/product-accessories/battery-device-adapter-c-d-size">here</a>. 
									You can also make your own battery 
									interrupters by soldering a pair of wires (or a speaker wire) to a 3.5mm jack and to two small metal plates separated by double-sided tape or some other 
									thin insulator.  However, if you are not comfortable soldering, this guide will teach you how to make a battery interrupter with only a few dollars worth 
									of parts (or the scraps left from making a <a href="#cdswitch">CD Switch</a>).</p>
								<p><strong>I have posted an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/No-Solder-Battery-Interrupter/">Instructable</a>, so that anyone can easily make their own 
									no-solder battery interrupters.</strong> I suggest making one of these along with a <a href="#cdswitch">CD Switch</a>, 
									as they work well together, and the battery interrupter can be made of the scraps left from building the switch.</p>
								<p>A <a href="/docs/battery_interrupter_instructable.pdf">PDF version</a> of the Instructable is also available.</p>
								<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> I used two of these to build the <a href="#combatchair">Nerf Combat Wheelchair</a>.</p>

								<p>In the realm of assistive technology, a switch (aka "ability switch") can be anything from a plastic button to a muscle twitch sensor. A 
									<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/switches">wide variety of switches</a> are available, and can be selected to fit the 
									needs of each user. These switches are almost always wired to a 3.5mm (1/8") mono plug, and can be connected to anything with a matching jack. They are used 
									with power wheelchairs, computers, speech devices, toys, remote controls, and so on.</p>
								<p>The problem is that switches are expensive.  A basic Jellybean Switch or Buddy Button costs around $50-60 (USD), for just a plastic button.  While these are worth 
									their weight in gold, the price is still a bit steep, especially in the low-budget/non-profit world of assistive technology.</p>
								<p>Sometimes, it's handy to make your own.</p>
								<p>Fortunately, a switch is a very simple thing.  It's just a circuit closing, just two wires touching.  We will use less than $10 (USD) worth of parts to let a person 
									press a surface (in this case a CD), and touch two wires together.  R. J. Cooper also sells 
									<a href="https://store.rjcooper.com/products/switch-kits-cd?variant=48031358863">CD Switch Kits</a> for about $10 (USD) each, in packs of five or ten.</p>
								<p>Save the left over scraps from this project, as you can use them to build a <a href="#batteryint">No-Solder Battery Interrupter</a>, which you can use to let this 
									switch control toys and other devices.</p>
								<p><strong>I have posted an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/CD-Switch/">Instructable</a>, so that anyone can easily make their own CD Switches.</strong> I suggest making one

								<h2 class="major" style="width:100%">Nerf combat wheelchair</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/combat_wheelchair.png" alt="Wheelchair with Nerf machineguns mounted" /></span>
						
								<p>You might ask yourself, "Why would anyone mount dual Nerf machine guns on a wheelchair, and hack it to fire them from the drive controls?"</p>
								<p>I might ask you why you hate fun.</p>
								<p>The guns can be fired by any drive control connected to the chair.  Joystick, head array, chin/mouth stick, sip and puff, single switch, etc.  Pick your poison.</p>
								<p>I used an Invacare wheelchair with Mark VI electronics, but this can be done with any power wheelchair that can use an "ECU 1/2" or "ECU 3/4" box.  (These connect to the chair's 
									electronics and have two 9-pin D-sub ports for output.  They are commonly used for controlling speech generating devices or computers.)</p>
								<p>Some of the parts may be quite expensive, but it's possible to find cheaper alternatives if you get creative.</p>
								<p>The recipe:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Switch adapt two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Vulcan-EBF-25-Blaster/dp/B0013U95U2/">Nerf Vulcan machine guns</a> using <a href="#batteryint">battery interrupters</a> and two zip ties. 
										(<strong>Edit:</strong> It seems the Nerf Vulcan has become quite rare/expensive, so see the bottom of the page for alternatives.)</li>
									<li>Acquire two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-143N-Magic-Arm-without/dp/B000HI8L38/">Manfrotto Magic Arms</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-Magic-Backlite-Stand-Super/dp/B000J4GQVE/">kits</a> 
										(which are the same thing as "<a href="https://www.ablenetinc.com/technology/mounting-cases">Universal Mounts</a>," 
										but cheaper because they aren't marketed as assistive technology...), and two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-035RL-Super-Clamp-Standard/dp/B0018LQVIA/">extra clamps</a> (four clamps total).</li>
									<li>Attach a clamp to each end of each Magic Arm.</li>
									<li>For each gun, clamp one end of the arm onto the tripod's mount, and the other onto the frame of the wheelchair.  Adjust to position and aim however you like.</li>
									<li>Mount an "ECU 1/2" or "ECU 3/4" box on the wheelchair and connect it to the chair's electronics. 
										(This is the sort of thing that a supplier or clinic would do for you, as it requires a brand-specific wheelchair programming device.)</li>
									<li>Plug a 9-pin D-sub to 3.5mm splitter cable (like one of the "802-" cables show <a href="http://www.asl-inc.com/products/catalogs/Catalog-Series800.pdf">here</a> or a home-made version) into one of the ports of the ECU box.</li>
									<li>Choose two of the 3.5mm plugs (left and right, or whichever directions work best for the user while driving the chair), 
										and plug them into the battery interrupters of the Nerf guns.  (Alternatively, use a Y-adapter and connect one plug to both guns.)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>That's it!  Now, tap your mode switch (or whatever you have to do with your brand of wheelchair) to switch into ECU mode, and move your joystick (or whatever drive control you use).  You are now driving an AH-64 Apache attack wheelchair. 
									Paint some shark teeth on that beast and show 'em who's boss!</p>
								<p><strong>A note on Nerf guns:</strong> Apparently, the Nerf Vulcan has become quite rare and/or expensive these days, but there are other guns that will do the job. 
									As you can see in <a href="http://switchgaming.blogspot.com/2014/04/wadsa-accessible-sports.html">this fantastic video</a>, others have set up similar rigs with the 
									<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-94665-N-Strike-Stampede-ECS/dp/B003774W6Q/">N-Strike Stampede ECS</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-32218-Vortex-Nitron/dp/B004SKX8M0/">Vortex Nitron</a>. 
									While I have not experimented with either of these myself, I expect that the Stampede can be adapted very similarly to the Vulcan. 
									The Vortex Nitron might (or might not) be slightly more complicated to adapt, as it looks like it may have a secondary switch to turn on the motor, 
									but you may be able to just turn it on and leave it.  After a quick test, the 
									<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Rapidstrike-Blaster/dp/B00BG8F0H8/">Rapidstrike CS-18</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Rayven-Blaster/dp/B009T45XVE/">Rayven CS-18</a> don't seem to be viable options, 
									as they have a secondary trigger that must be held to power the motor, which complicates things. 
									It seems that new models continue to be released, while old models skyrocket in price, so it may take some research to find the right gun. If the price is more than $100 (USD), it's probably an overpriced old model.</p>
								<p>As of October 2017, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXT52FY/">N-Strike Elite Rhino-Fire Blaster</a> looks like the most likely candidate at ~$70 (USD), but I haven't tested it myself.</p>
								<p>If you want to try this out, I will gladly provide more details.</p>
